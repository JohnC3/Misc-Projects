# Code_practice
Just misc code questions and rough work. Nothing to see here. move along.

Sorts from memory is an attempt to see how long it takes for me to remember the same basic algorithms from memory by writing them from my recollection of how they work.

Eventually going to want to automate the testing of these algorithms with unittests so I don't memorize a flawed or poor implementation
